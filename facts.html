             <h2>History & Exploration</h2>

	       <br>

	     <ul>
	       <li class="origins">
  		 <p><strong>Origins.  </strong>You probably heard of, or read about the legend of the origins of the marathon race. According to the legend, the Greek messenger <strong>Philippides ran 26.2 miles (~42.195km)</strong> from the <strong>town of Marathon to Athens</strong> to give news of the victory of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Marathon" target="_blank">Battle of Marathon</a> in 490 B.C.E..</p>

<!-- Image Athens stadium -->

		    <h5 class="captionAthens"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finish line at Athens stadium&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h5>
		  </div>
              
	      <p>Although Richard A. Billows suggests that it was actually the entire Greek army who marched rapidly back to defend Athens, in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Marathon-Battle-Changed-Western-Civilization/dp/1590205685" target="_blank"><em>Marathon: How One Battle Changed Western Civilization</em></a>, what is crucial to know here is that the <strong>victory</strong> was a decisive, <strong>game-changing event</strong> in Ancient Greece, for the overwhelmingly outnumbered Athenians then perceived the Persian army as "invincible". More strikingly, the <strong>classical Greek culture</strong> would not have had its <strong>remarkable influence on Western culture</strong> if the Athenians had not defeated the invading Persians, against all odds.</p>

	      <p>
		Symbolically, there is a <a href="http://www.athensauthenticmarathon.gr/index.php?lang=en" target="_blank">yearly race</a> organized for those willing to <strong>run or walk the original course</strong> (no, I have not run it yet, it's  on my to-do list).
	      </p>
	      
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      <p><strong>The science behind running.</strong> The documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60a8FrInJY8" target="_blank"><em>The Evolutionary History of Jogging</em></a> discusses how our ancestors ran barefoot for a very long time and how running barefoot differs from running with shoes. Dr. Daniel Schmitt, an evolutionary anthropologist at Duke University, is studying together with <a href="https://www.fas.harvard.edu/~skeleton/danlhome.html" target="_blank">Dr Daniel E. Lieberman</a> of Harvard University how<strong> humans have evolved into being such good distance runners</strong>.</p>

	      <p>The <a href="http://www.istanbulmarathon.org/en/about-marathon/42k-marathon/" target="_blank"><strong>Istanbul Eurasia Marathon</strong></a> is the only official marathon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul_Marathon" target="_blank">beginning in one continent (Asia) and ending in another (Europe)</a>. I wonder if you need to carry your passport and visa with you or if you're granted diplomatic immunity when crossing the border.</p>

	    <li>
	      <p>The scenic <a href="https://www.thesfmarathon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>San Francisco Marathon</strong></a>, which takes place in July, is not as hilly as one might think. For half-marathoners, the city's runs offer the unique advantage of allowing to choose between 2 different routes. According to <a href="https://www.quora.com/Reviews-of-The-San-Francisco-Marathon" target="_blank">Inna Vishik</a>, the first half is so "stunning" that "it will seriously make you happy to be alive". The <a href="http://confessionsofanamateurathlete.blogspot.nl/2014/08/the-san-francisco-marathon-race-review.html" target="_blank">Confessions of an Amateur Athlete</a> blog features a review of the marathon, along with pictures, including official ones provided by the race organizers for free, which is a rare thing!
	      </p>

	    <li>
	      <p><strong>La Cr&#232;me de La Cr&#232;me</strong>. The <a href="http://eu.ironman.com/#axzz3qrmjP7Ld" target="_blank"><strong>Ironman</strong></a> is the <strong>ultimate triathlon event</strong>: it starts with a 2.4-mile (3.86 km) swim, followed by a 112-mile (180.25 km) bicycle ride and ends with... a marathon. Way to cool down after a grueling swim and bike ride! Most Ironman events have a time limit of 17 hours.</p>
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      <p><strong>D-Day beaches: <a href="http://www.lescourantsdelaliberte.com/en/" target="_blank">The Freedom Marathon</a></strong> in Normandy, France is part of a yearly commemoration of D-Day. The course has mixed reviews; although it is criticized for the flaws of it organization, participants mainly keep moving memories of their experiences. You can find detailed reviews of the course <a href="http://www.marathonguide.com/races/racedetails.cfm?MIDD=1213150614" target="_blank">here</a>. If you have the chance to go there, it is definitely worth doing some sightseeing. You can for instance visit medieval castles such as the ones in <a href="http://www.caen-tourisme.fr/en/discover-caen/william-the-conqueror/the-ducal-castel" target="_blank"> Caen</a> and in <a href="http://www.chateau-guillaume-leconquerant.fr/index_uk.php" target="_blank">Falaise</a>, birth town of William the Duke of Normandy, nicknamed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror" target="_blank">William the Conqueror</a>, as he is the only Frenchman in history to have conquered England.</p>

		 <p><em><strong>"The Girl Who Started it All"</strong></em>. In 1967, 19 year-old journalism student Kathrine Switzer was the <strong>first woman to enter</strong> and complete the <strong>Boston marathon</strong>. She draw much media attention for doing so, particularly when the <strong>race organizer</strong> chased her to <strong>try to pull her out of the race</strong>.</p> 
		 <p>Kathrine later wrote a memoir, <a href="http://kathrineswitzer.com/author/books/" target="_blank"><em>Marathon Woman</em></a>, where she tells of her hard training prior to her decision of registering for the race, of the support male runners showed her, of her <strong>ensuing engagement</strong> to create opportunities for others and <strong>get official status for women in distance races and other sports</strong>. In 1972, Boston allowed women to enter the marathon, providing that they met the men's qualifying time of 3:30. The portion about Kathrine's Boston experience can be found in her <a href="http://kathrineswitzer.com/about-kathrine/1967-boston-marathon-the-real-story/" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p>

		 <p><strong>The ultimate selfless act</strong>. Elite runner <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jacqueline.kiplimo" target="_blank">Jacqueline Kiplimo</a> finished second and missed a $10,000 prize in <a href="http://sfglobe.com/2015/06/02/kenyan-athlete-helps-chinese-man-with-no-hands-drink-water/" target="_blank">2010 China Zhengkai International Marathon</a> for helping a struggling, dehydrated fellow runner by running by his side for a major portion of the race. Jacqueline's act of kindness won many hearts and her humility can clearly be seen in <a href="http://jackiplimo.blogspot.nl/" target="_blank">her interviews</a>.</p>

		 <p><strong>It's never too late to start</strong>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauja_Singh" target="_blank">Fauja Singh</a> (104), currently holds the world record in his age bracket. He <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/page/Fauja-Singh/fauja-singh-runner" target="_blank">ran his first marathon at age 89,</a> and continued with running until he turned 101. Now, I think his performance needs no further explanation. R-E-S-P-E-C-T.</p>

		 <img class="siabatou" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCdoqRaWIAA9WdL.jpg:large" alt="siabatouP">
		 
		 <p><strong>Just to get water</strong>. While browsing for marathon news last spring, the picture of a specific lady wearing a sign caught my attention. Gambian woman Siabatou Sanneh wore sandals (sure, why not) and <a href="http://www.euronews.com/2015/04/13/woman-carries-can-of-water-on-her-head-along-paris-marathon/" target="_blank">carried a jerrycan of water on her head along the 42 km</a> (definitely handy when you're dehydrated and there is no aid station around). Silly comments aside, Siabatou did so to <a href="http://themarathonwalker.com/" target="_blank">raise awareness</a> that some women in her home country have to walk this distance to find clean drinking water. This calls for a hashtag<strong> #ibelieveinheroes</strong>.</p>
	       </li>
       
	       <li>
		 <p><strong>The signs that get you going</strong>. Some are funny, some cheeky, some are imaginative even... but they all work. Here's a sample of my personal favorites.</p>

<!-- Disney 2014 Marathon embedded video -->
	       
	       <p><strong>On Costumes, Disney and Star Wars</strong>. Surely you've seen pictures of racers with the craziest costumes. In my opinion, the most impressive ones are group costumes. What beautiful examples of team spirit!</p>
	       <p><strong>Have an excuse to let your inner child come out for a whole weekend</strong>. From January, 6 to January, 10, <strong>Disney</strong> organizes a <a href="http://www.rundisney.com/disneyworld-marathon/" target="_blank"><strong>fantasy like marathon weekend</strong></a> at their resort in Florida. There is a run every day; 5k, 10k, a half marathon and a full one on Sunday. If you're up to the challenge, you may run them all! Clearly more of a fun marathon rather than a place to set a personal best, particularly if you want to pose next to your favorite characters, who for once are acting both as spectators and entertainers. That said, I'm sure you don't queue as much to take a photo with them as you normally would when visiting the park. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLoCzBL7Shw" target="_blank">video</a> is a good summary of the race.</p>
	       <p><a href="http://www.rundisney.com/star-wars-wdw-half-marathon/" target="_blank"><strong>Inaugural Star Wars half-marathon weekend</strong></a>, April 14-17, 2016, also in Florida. There is no full yet, but this one is intriguing as it's the first. You can run either the 10K of the half. Hardcore participants can also <strong>take the Dark Side challenge</strong>, where they choose their alliance and each get rewarded with three medals.</p>

	       <p><strong>Dawn Dais' guide for non-runners</strong>. Dawn Dais is a journalist and graphic designer who never liked working out. She took the courage to train for and run a marathon in honor of her grandfather and in order to be able to check a goal off her bucket list.</p> 
	       <p>In her book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Nonrunners-Marathon-Guide-Women/dp/1580052053" target="_blank">The Nonrunner's Marathon Guide for Women: Get Off Your Butt and On with Your Training</a></em>, she chronicles with a high dose of humor the different stages of her training, how little she enjoyed it, and how she overcame her aversion. The book was recommended by a friend of mine, I read it before running my first half. A good read for a wannabe runner.</p>
	    
	     </li>

	     <li>
	       <p><strong>The Stages of Running</strong>. I find the video below from Buzzfeed hilarious and quite a realistic depiction of the mental stages of running the whole distance:

	       <p><strong>On the Runner's High</strong>. It is not a myth... The post-run euphoria feels pretty much the same as any form of accomplishment and makes you do things such as uncontrollably dancing and singing to 80s music.</p>
